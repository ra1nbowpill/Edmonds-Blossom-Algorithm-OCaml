# Edmonds-Blossom-Algorithm-OCaml
A try at implementing the Blossom algorithm for matching in arbitrary graphs.

For now there is only a file containing all the useful code, so the code can be
run within emacs using tuareg for easy debug.
All modules in the "blossom_clean.ml" file were written by Guyslain Naves
(http://assert-false.net/guyslain/).

This is it for now.
